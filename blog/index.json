Read on to learn how\nwe have been replacing the legacy webshop one tiny bit at a time. I also hope\nto share my continual amazement at how much work can be postponed to be able to\ndeliver a &quot;feature&quot; early.</p>\n<p><em>A part of the <a href=\"/tech-blog/tags/nettbutikk\">series Nettbutikk Team&#39;s Experiences and Experiments</a></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"my-best-project-ever\">My best ‘project’ ever</h2>\n<p>Nettbutikk.netcom.no is the best project - though I rather say product development -\nI have ever been to. When asked why, this was my answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Full stack &amp; full control: frontend, backend, ops. Great people &amp; ideally\nsmall team. Very pragmatic, minimalistic and evolutionary approach to the dev\nprocess. Working closely with the business and seeing the app actually matters\nto them and influences real people every day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We do everything - front-end, back-end, operations, we deploy whenever we want to.</li>\n<li>The team is really small and totally awesome</li>\n<li>We sit together with the business and work together all the time</li>\n<li>The application is really important for the business - and every line of code\nI release to production can improve (or destroy) the experiences for thousands\nof people.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are many things I am excited about in this project but today I want to focus on one thing.</p>\n<p>Normally when people speak about their favourite project, they brag about what\nthey did. I want to brag about what we have not done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background-extreme-minimalism-mind-set\">Background: Extreme Minimalism Mind-set</h2>\n<p>One of the great things about this team is its minimalist mind-set:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We get by with the minimal process possible, and continually evolve it,\nadd and (preferably) remove from it as we learn and our needs change. No Jira,\nno demos (the business sees every new change anyway), no retrospectives (we\npractice continuous improvement), ...</li>\n<li>We are library and tool skeptics (thanks, Alex!) - we only add a it if we\nreally need to, if skipping it or writing it ourselves isn’t reasonable</li>\n<li>We always try to trim a feature down to the bare minimum and release the\nsmallest possible chunk of functionality that adds any value to us,\nthe business, or our customers &lt;--- this is what I will focus on today</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"the-goal-of-nettbutikk-netcom-no\">The goal of nettbutikk.netcom.no</h2>\n<p>NetCom had - or actually has - this huge, inflexible webshop rented from a 3rd\nparty and customized. But the business wanted something different, something\nthat would actually fit their needs, evolve continuously, enable them to experiment.\nSomething where the time from an idea to production wouldn&#39;t be months but days\nor hours.</p>\n<p>So they have decided to get a few skilled developers, having them sitting together\nwith the business (instead of being outsourced) and writing their own webshop.</p>\n<p>To me this sounds very scary. As far as I know, most of the &quot;let’s ditch this\nnon-trivial software and write it from scratch&quot; projects fail badly.</p>\n<p>And when you think about it, you need a lot to implement a webshop:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/extreme_minimalism-webshop_needs.png\" alt=\"webshop_needs\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You obviously need a database</li>\n<li>Get data from primary sources and transform the for the views</li>\n<li>Enhance / override the primary data</li>\n<li>Product listing (for all product types)</li>\n<li>Product details page (for all product types)</li>\n<li>Checkout, payment</li>\n<li>Filtering, search, categories</li>\n<li>Analytics</li>\n<li>user login</li>\n<li>(and certainly many things I have forgotten)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This sounds like at least 1 year project with a big-bang release at the end.\nYou cannot release half of a webshop, right? You can’t release a perfect webshop\nwithout checkout, where people can’t actually buy stuff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-first-release-\">Our first release:</h2>\n<p><strong>Product details page of a single product variant</strong></p>\n<p>Well, our first release was a single page - product details of one variant of\none product. We have released it in just a few weeks (though more than the two\nI hoped for).</p>\n<h2 id=\"here-it-is-\">Here it is:</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/extreme_minimalism-nettbutik_r1-page1.png\" alt=\"release 1 page 1\"></p>\n<p>So you would navigate the old shop and when you clicked on iPhone 6 plus 16GB,\nyou would come to our page. You could select a color, subscription, ...</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/extreme_minimalism-nettbutik_r1-page2.png\" alt=\"release 1 page 2\"></p>\n<p>... services and accessories. And when you clicked on the &quot;Fortsett&quot; button, you\nwould go to checkout in the old shop again. And even the &quot;shopping cart&quot; - the\nconfiguration of your order - would mostly just reuse the shopping cart in the\nold shop via an ugly iframe hack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-there-is-a-lot-we-did-not-need-to-do-\">So there is a lot we did not need to do:</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/extreme_minimalism-webshop-not_done.png\" alt=\"webshop-not_done\"></p>\n<p>Later, we extended it to all variants, all iPhones, eventually all phones,\nphone listing, all product types, ... .</p>\n<p>Nowadays, 10 months since start, we have everything, only the checkout still\nlives in the old system. (And we are looking forward to getting rid of it as well!)</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-four-techniques\">The Four Techniques</h2>\n<p>How do we do it? How do we trim the next chunk of functionality to the total minimum? We\napply these techniques:</p>\n<p><strong>You Don’t Need It Just Yet. Postpone it!</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do it manually</li>\n<li>Hardcode it</li>\n<li>Reuse</li>\n<li>Slice &amp; Dice</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The key principle is &quot;You Don’t Need It Just Yet&quot;. There is a lot you truly need,\nbut most likely it can wait a day - or a few weeks\n(and you can hardcode it or do it manually in the meantime).\nThe magic words &quot;in the first phase [or day]&quot; (and, possibly, &quot;experiment&quot;) can\nhelp you to get this across to the business people that are always eager to get\nmore cool stuff out. (And, of course, by doing less now we get eventually more done!)</p>\n<p>It is also very important to remember - and to communicate to the business - that\nyou only need not to be worse than the existing functionality - improvements,\nbug fixes, and additions may wait. (Even though we more less managed to follow\nthis maxim, everything we did is better and performs better than in the old shop :-) .)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do it manually - you can get shockingly far with doing things manually.\nDuring many months, our heroic biz people duplicated data between the old and\nnew webshop instead of automatically syncing them. And we still need to add\nnew phones manually to the webshop.</li>\n<li>Hardcode it - with just a few minutes to deploy, the developers sitting with\nthe business, and possibly only a small subset of\nproducts, a lot may be hard-coded instead of having a CMS to add/override data.\nThese days, when we need to show &quot;Checkout down for maintenance,&quot; we still just\nchange it in code, release, and then re-deploy the previous version.</li>\n<li>Reuse what is there, even though it certainly gets ugly quickly. We have\nreused the shopping cart via an iframe and still use the checkout process in the\nold shop.</li>\n<li>Slice &amp; Dice: Release the smallest subset of the feature for just one use\ncase / target group first. We have started with a page for a single product\nvariant - which decreased the complexity considerably. And when developing a new\ncart functionality, we applied it first just to accessories - and only the part\nusers cannot see in the UI (though they use it).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am constantly surprised how far we can get with these.\nIt works best when having colleagues that challenge you on doing even less, on\nhardcoding and doing manually a little more than you would want to. (We are\ndevelopers after all, we love automation!)</p>\n<h2 id=\"always-ask-\">Always ask:</h2>\n<p><strong>Do I need it <em>now</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>(Hint: Most of the time the answer is no.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-know-more-\">Want to know more?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://netcom.no/disrupt-us\">Work with me!</a></li>\n<li>Contanct me at Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HolyJak\">@HolyJak</a></li>\n<li>Learn more about our journey at the <a href=\"teliasonera.github.io/tech-blog/\">TeliaSonera Tech Blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n","path":"blog/extreme-minimalism-replacing-shop-netcom-no-one-tiny-bit-at-a-time-smidig-2015-transcript","excerpt":"Replacing legacy systems typically starts with an excitement, proceeds through\nmonths or years of work, and results in a failure.

We are quite excited about it\nand would like to share our experiences, successes, and failures for the amusement\nand inspiration of our readers.</p>\n<p>When asked why we think this team and product development were so great, this\nwas my answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Full stack &amp; full control: frontend, backend, ops.

Working closely with the business and seeing the app actually\nmatters to them and influences real people every day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-project-about-\">What is the project about?</h2>\n<p>The project started as an experiment. It grew out of the pain with the old\nhuge and inflexible webshop rented from a third party. The business wanted\nsomething that would fit their needs, that could evolve, enable them to experiment.\nSomething, where the time from an idea to production would be days or hours, not\nmonths.</p>\n<p>So they have decided to get a small team of highly skilled developers, sitting\nand working together with the business, and write their own, better webshop.\nThe hypothesis was that even with expensive skilled Norwegian developers, it\nwould pay off thanks to more satisfied customers that would more easily find\nwhat they wanted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-considered-extreme-\">Why is considered &quot;extreme&quot;?</h2>\n<p>There multiple things considered &quot;extreme&quot; about this team. We have released to\nproduction, to real customers, only in a few weeks, including just a single\nproduct page. We deploy whenever we want to, and do our own operations, using\nthe cloud instead of the enterprise infrastructure. Our development process is\nminimalistic, we don&#39;t follow a methodology, we create (and re-create) our own,\nusing only a physical Kanban board instead of Jira. And we run on Node.js instead\nof the standard JVM. We have ditched e-mail and started using Slack instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-little-of-history\">A little of history</h2>\n<p>The project started in February 2015 as an experiment. The first release - a\nsingle page for one variant of one phone - came after 7 weeks (though the\noptimists hoped for 2). Then it steadily grew and a month ahead of the planned\nexperiment end it was deemed successful. By summer, the whole webshop with the\nexception of checkout was in the new system, and it was better and more\nperformant then the old one. That enabled a large re-design for a summer campaign.\nThe business started with A/B experiments and there was a steady flow of new\nfeatures and improvements, with focus shifting gradually towards implementing\ncheckout directly in the new webshop. When the newest iPhone arrived, the system\nhandled the increased load formidably (contrary to some backend systems, sadly).</p>\n<h2 id=\"meet-the-team\">Meet the team</h2>\n<p>The core team that started the journey consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alex York, master of all things CSS and JS with a .Net background, love of TDD,\n  and ultimate judge of code quality and understandability</li>\n<li>Jakob Lind, the get-things-done guy, an Emacs and functional programming fanboy,\n  always on lookout for better ways to do things</li>\n<li>Jakub Holý, the operations and data specialist and Clojre(Script) evangelist</li>\n<li>Ketil Jensen, our &quot;agile coach,&quot; and a shield and liaison between us and the rest of the organization</li>\n<li>Magnus Indregård, our primary business representative</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the developers are very capable, they all are very pragmatic and favour\nthe lean way. Yet they have different background and approaches. The similarities\ngive us a strong push towards minimalism and getting stuff out, while the\ndifferences spark valuable discussions and lead to a much better process and code.</p>\n","path":"blog/introducing-the-series-nettbutikk-team-s-experiences-and-experiments","excerpt":"A part of the series Nettbutikk Team's Experiences and Experiments"},{"title":"Nettbutikk: The No Status Standup Experiment","date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Jakub Holý","tags":["nettbutikk","product development","lean"],"contents":"<p><em>A part of the <a href=\"/tech-blog/tags/nettbutikk\">series Nettbutikk Team&#39;s Experiences and Experiments</a></em></p>\n<p>The Nettbutikk team likes to challenge all established truths.

The eternal dilemma","date":"2015-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","description":"The pain of upgrading project dependencies vs. not upgrading","author":"Jakub Holý","tags":["nettbutikk","experience","development","learning"],"contents":"<p><em>A part of the <a href=\"/tech-blog/tags/nettbutikk\">series Nettbutikk Team&#39;s Experiences and Experiments</a></em></p>\n<p>Handling dependencies is one of important challenges in any software project -\nand especially in the fast-moving JavaScript world. Our\n<a href=\"nettbutikk.netcom.no\">Nettbutikk</a> team just had a heated discussion about\nhandling upgrades of our dependencies that continuous our learning journey lined\nwith failures (or rather &quot;experiments that generated new knowledge&quot; :-)).</p>\n<h2 id=\"failed-attempt-one-let-tools-do-it\">Failed attempt one: Let tools do it</h2>\n<p>Originally we let <code>npm</code> automatically\ndo minor upgrades but that turned out to be problematic as even minor version\nchanges can introduce bugs and having potentially different (minor) versions on\nour different machines and in production makes troubleshooting difficult.</p>\n<p>Also, this only takes care about minor version changes. When we decided to do\nthe bigger updates, we had a lot of work and testing to do, making sure all the\nnew versions work together. Troubleshooting of upgrade problems was difficult\nsince many libraries were changed at once so pinpointing the source of a new\ndefect was nontrivial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"failed-attempt-two-let-a-human-do-it\">Failed attempt two: Let a human do it</h2>\n<p>Next we decided to freeze the library versions completely and let the one of us\nthat had the operations role that week run <code>npm outdated</code>, update all\ndependencies, and verify everything still worked.</p>\n<p>Thus we ensured that we were almost always up-to-date and that we typically had\nonly a small job to do, with just a small potential for problems. However it\nwasn&#39;t frictionless either. It might require one or few hours (for proper\ntesting and occasional troubleshooting) every week, a time we would have rather\nused on creating new value. And sometimes the upgrade did introduce problems -\nsome spot and fixed immediately, but some taking more time to discover and fix.\nOnce it took two weeks to find out that something broke due to a <code>Reflux</code> upgrade -\nand finding out that the cause was the upgrade wasn&#39;t easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-experiment-upgrade-as-needed\">New experiment: Upgrade as-needed</h2>\n<p>Our reliable though-challenger Alex pointed out that upgrades give us typically\nlittle value at a relatively high cost. So we have decided to try not upgrading\nlibraries unless we would have a good reason to do it (such as a known security\nproblem or a new functionality we want). It is obviously not optimal and the\nupgrades might be big and painful but we will try it for a while and evaluate\nhow it works for us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Handling and upgrading dependencies is difficult and costly. It&#39;s important to\nevaluate the cost-benefit ration and experiment to find the &quot;least bad&quot; approach and\nbalance for a particular team.

The event was attended by 15 people, forming 5 different teams. Snacks and drinks were on the house. Pizza was served to the hungry late stayers. But most importantly: During the day we saw many good ideas shape up and worked on. A passionate group worked hard throughout the day. Some working on internal tools, other groups on customer facing products and new concepts. The results were presented at 9 AM the morning after. And after a vote later in the afternoon, we could announce two &quot;winners&quot;. The attendees reported back that they really enjoyed our afternoon-hack event, so we will definitely do more of that in the future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n    I have not failed. I&#39;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#39;t work.\n  </p>\n  <footer><cite title=\"Thomas A. Edison\">Thomas A. Edison</cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-are-we-doing-it-\">Why are we doing it?</h3>\n<p>First and foremost: To learn! If TS is going to stay competetive in the Telco market, then we need to learn faster than our competitors. We know we need to find new products and services to attract new customers and retain those that we already have. To do that we think we need to do at least 2 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an environment where experimentation and learning can happen</li>\n<li>Run experiments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a hectic work day it is not realistic to think that people will be able to create time and space to innovate. At least not in the short run. Thus, we need to change the envioronment.  Our hypothesis was that a hack day (or a half hack day), could be such a learning environment. After the first experiment we still believe that, but we need to run more experiments to  further improve. Other reasons to arrange a hack day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have fun</li>\n<li>Learn new skills</li>\n<li>Get to know colleagues, also from other departments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although having fun and learning new skills is obviously very important (we believe in creating a work place where people can have fun), I want to especially emphasize the importance of the last point above. We believe that events like these can be a really great way to <strong>tear down some of the functional silos that exists in the organization</strong>, to create new relationships across departments. The first time around we had a few from the business side. Next time around we hope to get more people from lots of differents departments to attend: More people from the business side, marketing, sales, HR and so on. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-hack-day-\">What is a Hack day?</h3>\n<p>A hack day is a timeboxed event where people meet to work on ideas they have for a new product, play around with new technology, together with other people. This creates an environment where people can focus on developing an idea they have without all the interferences that people normally have in their daily job. </p>\n<h3 id=\"start-small-ship-it-and-improve\">Start small, ship it and improve</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n    The only purpose of starting is to finish, and while the projects we do are never really finished, they must ship.<br>  </p>\n  <footer><cite title=\"Seth Godin\">Seth Godin</cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thinking small enough can be really difficult, but we believe it to be incredibly important. So we wanted to take this approach when launching hack day. A hack day normally lasts a full day, from morning to afternoon/evening. To start small we decided that our first experiment should be a bit shorter, starting from lunch and lasting to whenever people needed to leave. Starting with a short event made it not only easier for people to attend. It also felt like a safe-to-fail experiment, where we could test out the concept and learn (see &quot;What we learned&quot; below). </p>\n<h3 id=\"show-us-what-you-ve-learned\">Show us what you&#39;ve learned</h3>\n<p>Teams were challenged to present their hacks on the morning after, at 9AM. To keep things transparent and simple we decided to do the presentations in the open office space. Quite a few people got interested in what was going, and with some good presentations being made we managed to raise additional interest in our afternoon hack day. Next time we hope to have even more people joining. People has already started asking when our next event will take place. </p>\n<p>In the afternoon we invited everybody to vote for two winners; best customer facing product and best internal product. No fancy prizes, just the honors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tech-blog/images/hack-day-presentation-1.jpg\" alt=\"Presentation of hacks\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"what-we-learned-from-arranging-the-event-\">What we learned from arranging the event?</h3>\n<p>We tried hard to keep our first event as simple as possible. That approach worked really well. The table below summarizes our key learnings from the event, tools and other learnings.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">What</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">How</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Did it work?</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Learning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Communication</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"http://slack.com\">Slack</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Slack is awesome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Idea gathering</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"http://trello.com\">Trello</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Invite broadly to get more ideas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Voting</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"http://trello.com\">Trello</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">You need Trello gold to enable voting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Registration</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"http://eventbrite.com\">Eventbrite</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">No</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Complicating things</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Presentation</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">In open office area</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Transparency is king</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Since we decided to do a shorter hack day for our first experiment, we accepted that teams presented concepts as hacks. In fact, the two winning teams did not have a potentially shippable product. Next time around, if we are doing a full hack day, we will focus more on getting some minimum products finished. </p>\n","path":"blog/afternoon-hack","excerpt":"A few thursdays ago we arranged our very first hack day at TeliaSonera.
