* Don't follow a methodology - lead, explore, learn
* No retro - ongoing process improvement
* Minimal standup (link)
* phys board
    * Current + week milestone + KPIs
    * Two lanes
    * No done
* occasional planning
* biz sitting with devs, talking constantly
* no demos
* release anytime

## Values

* Challenge established practices and truths - especially our own
* Minimalism - process, lib/tool skepticism
