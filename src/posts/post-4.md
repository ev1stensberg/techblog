*A part of the [series Nettbutikk Team's Experiences and Experiments](/tech-blog/tags/nettbutikk)*

The Nettbutikk team likes to challenge all established truths. Jakob Lind has
come with with an excellent question: do we need standups? Do we all need to
stand in front of our Kanban board and discuss what was and will be, especially
since we often already know that, thanks to communication all the time?

We have agreed to keep the standups but to limit hem to:

1. A brief review of what has been deployed to production the previous day
2. Any blockers, problems, and requests for help

i.e. skipping the reporting of the status of tasks if they progress "according
to the plan" and there is nothing noteworthy about them. Of course participants
can ask, if they want to know. And they should do so, if they f.ex. feel a task is
taking too long.

Minimalism for the win!
